Library I use for interfacing with a 2" 176*220 LCD I bought from www.tinylcd.com.
The seller does not provide the driver name or any other details but provides PIC code to test the LCD.
I am mostly guessing the driver name from the search results based on the markings on the lcd. 

This library is a combination of that code converted to Arduino compatible code + Adafruit sample code + code from other drivers I managed to find on the internet.

The code is GPL3 unless someone has an objection.
